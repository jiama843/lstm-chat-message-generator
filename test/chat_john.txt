btw are we doing anything after sushi
same
nice
yeah, i beat the guy first try lol
this game is still unfair as fuck lmao
LOL im so done with this garbage game
ive been regularly depositing money in this bank cuz its pretty easy to lose
after finishing an area, idk where to go next, so i go through every route before seeing a key on sale on a shop for 800
i have 200 on me, so i decide to go to the bank and the bitch is gone
now i can't buy the key to get to the next area, and i search up online how to get my money back
turns out that you can get your money back but only 2 entire areas later
up until this point there is no need for money, but apparently for the next area you need 800 for this key + 1800 for this lantern
which is great since ive been depositing regularly and it basically took the entire game up until this point to gain exactly that much
so i have to grind for something that i had enough money to afford, and i think that crosses the annoying bullshit line
oh i forgot, apparently she is also located in an area that is only accessible with a key that costs 950
so it's even more grinding
worst part is, if i knew about this beforehand, i could've avoided it entirely, so if I read spoilers, i may have actually gotten through this game, but now I'm never picking it up again
i have very mixed feelings about this game
i'm stopping because i don't want to waste time grinding
and i don't believe its worth seeing the rest of the game
k
i'm feeling zak in general
hmm i was going to eat there
sure
as long as it doesn't involve Sherry and guns, i'm good
* Sherry + guns
the proof is left as an exercise to the reader
i'm actually more interested in your search query
<@!148598770735513600> Nice
yes, but it's already pretty cheap anyways
i like this game so far, but there is a serious gameplay issue i have
